.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemlog_ctl_get\f[](), \f[B]pmemlog_ctl_set\f[]() and
\f[B]pmemlog_ctl_exec\f[]() functions provide a uniform interface for
querying and modifying the internal behavior of \f[B]libpmemlog\f[](7)
through the control (CTL) namespace.
.PP
The \f[I]name\f[] argument specifies an entry point as defined in the
CTL namespace specification.
The entry point description specifies whether the extra \f[I]arg\f[] is
required.
Those two parameters together create a CTL query.
The functions and the entry points are thread\-safe unless indicated
otherwise below.
If there are special conditions for calling an entry point, they are
explicitly stated in its description.
The functions propagate the return value of the entry point.
If either \f[I]name\f[] or \f[I]arg\f[] is invalid, \-1 is returned.
.PP
If the provided ctl query is valid, the CTL functions will always return
0 on success and \-1 on failure, unless otherwise specified in the entry
point description.
.PP
See more in \f[B]pmem_ctl\f[](5) man page.
.SH CTL NAMESPACE
.PP
prefault.at_create | rw | global | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
If set, every page of the pool will be touched and written to when the
pool is created, in order to trigger page allocation and minimize the
performance impact of pagefaults.
Affects only the \f[B]pmemlog_create\f[]() function.
.PP
Always returns 0.
.PP
prefault.at_open | rw | global | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
If set, every page of the pool will be touched and written to when the
pool is opened, in order to trigger page allocation and minimize the
performance impact of pagefaults.
Affects only the \f[B]pmemlog_open\f[]() function.
.PP
Always returns 0.
.PP
sds.at_create | rw | global | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
If set, force\-enables or force\-disables SDS feature during pool
creation.
Affects only the \f[B]pmemlog_create\f[]() function.
See \f[B]pmempool_feature_query\f[](3) for informations about SDS
(SHUTDOWN_STATE) feature.
.PP
Always returns 0.
.PP
copy_on_write.at_open | rw | global | int | int | \- | boolean
.PP
If set, pool is mapped in such a way that modifications don't reach the
underlying medium.
From the user's perspective this means that when the pool is closed all
changes are reverted.
This feature is not supported for pools located on Device DAX.
.PP
Always returns 0.
.SH CTL EXTERNAL CONFIGURATION
.PP
In addition to direct function call, each write entry point can also be
set using two alternative methods.
.PP
The first method is to load a configuration directly from the
\f[B]PMEMLOG_CONF\f[] environment variable.
.PP
The second method of loading an external configuration is to set the
\f[B]PMEMLOG_CONF_FILE\f[] environment variable to point to a file that
contains a sequence of ctl queries.
.PP
